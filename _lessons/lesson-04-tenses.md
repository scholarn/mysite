Tenses are essential for expressing time in the English language. They allow us to describe actions that happened in the past, are happening in the present, or will happen in the future. Understanding verb tenses is key to speaking and writing clearly and effectively.

## What are Tenses?

A tense refers to the form of a verb that shows the **time** of an action or event. There are three main tenses in English:

1. **Past Tense** – Describes actions or events that **happened before** now.
2. **Present Tense** – Describes actions or events that are **happening now** or are generally true.
3. **Future Tense** – Describes actions or events that **will happen** after now.

Each of these tenses can be further divided into four aspects: **simple**, **continuous**, **perfect**, and **perfect continuous**. These aspects show whether an action is finished, ongoing, or repetitive. Let's explore each tense and its aspects in detail.
