In storytelling and writing, **direct** and **indirect narration** are essential tools for conveying dialogue and reported speech. Understanding the difference between these two forms of narration will enhance your writing skills and help you engage your readers more effectively.

## What Is Direct Narration?

**Direct narration** (or **direct speech**) refers to quoting the exact words spoken by a character or individual. It is typically enclosed in quotation marks and is often introduced by a reporting verb such as "said," "asked," or "replied."

### Structure of Direct Narration

**Reporting Verb + Quotation**

#### Examples:
- She said, “I will attend the meeting tomorrow.”
- John asked, “Are you coming to the party?”

### Key Features of Direct Narration

1. **Exact Words**: The speaker's exact words are presented.
2. **Quotation Marks**: Direct speech is always enclosed in quotation marks.
3. **Punctuation**: Commas and punctuation are used according to standard rules.
4. **Character Voice**: Direct narration conveys the tone and style of the speaker.

## What Is Indirect Narration?

**Indirect narration** (or **reported speech**) involves paraphrasing what someone else has said without quoting their exact words. It does not use quotation marks and often changes the verb tense and pronouns.

### Structure of Indirect Narration

**Reporting Verb + That + Paraphrased Statement**

#### Examples:
- She said that she would attend the meeting the next day.
- John asked if I was coming to the party.

### Key Features of Indirect Narration

1. **Paraphrased Content**: The speaker’s words are summarized or rephrased.
2. **No Quotation Marks**: Indirect speech does not require quotation marks.
3. **Tense Changes**: The verb tense may change (e.g., present to past).
4. **Pronoun Adjustments**: Pronouns may change based on the context.
