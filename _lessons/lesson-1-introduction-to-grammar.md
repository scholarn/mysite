English grammar is the foundation for effective communication. Whether you're writing a blog post, an email, or a report, a good understanding of grammar is essential. In this lesson, we’ll cover some key elements of English grammar to get you started.

## 1. Parts of Speech

The parts of speech are the building blocks of English sentences. Each word in a sentence falls under one of these categories:

- **Nouns**: Represent people, places, things, or ideas.
  _Examples: dog, London, happiness._

- **Pronouns**: Words that replace nouns.
  _Examples: he, she, it, they._

- **Verbs**: Words that express action or state of being.
  _Examples: run, is, seem._

- **Adjectives**: Words that describe nouns or pronouns.
  _Examples: beautiful, tall, fast._

- **Adverbs**: Words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
  _Examples: quickly, very, well._

- **Prepositions**: Words that show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and another word in the sentence.
  _Examples: on, in, under._

- **Conjunctions**: Words that connect words, phrases, or clauses.
  _Examples: and, but, because._

- **Interjections**: Words or phrases that express strong emotions.
  _Examples: wow, ouch, hey._

## 2. Sentence Structure

A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. Sentences are made up of **subjects** and **predicates**.

- **Subject**: The person or thing performing the action.
  _Example: The cat (subject) is sleeping._

- **Predicate**: Contains the verb and provides information about the subject.
  _Example: The cat **is sleeping** (predicate)._

### Types of Sentences

1. **Declarative**: Makes a statement.
   _Example: The sky is blue._

2. **Interrogative**: Asks a question.
   _Example: Is the sky blue?_

3. **Imperative**: Gives a command or request.
   _Example: Close the door._

4. **Exclamatory**: Expresses strong emotion.
   _Example: What a beautiful day!_

## 3. Subject-Verb Agreement

In English, the subject and verb must agree in number. This means:

- **Singular subjects** take singular verbs.
  _Example: The dog **runs** fast._

- **Plural subjects** take plural verbs.
  _Example: The dogs **run** fast._

Pay attention to tricky cases like:

- Collective nouns (e.g., team, family) are singular but can sometimes act as plural.
- Words like "everyone" and "nobody" are singular.

## 4. Tenses

Tenses indicate the time when an action takes place. There are three main tenses in English:

- **Present Tense**: Expresses actions happening now.
  _Example: She **runs** every day._

- **Past Tense**: Expresses actions that happened in the past.
  _Example: She **ran** yesterday._

- **Future Tense**: Expresses actions that will happen in the future.
  _Example: She **will run** tomorrow._
