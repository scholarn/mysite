**Subject-verb agreement** is a fundamental rule in English grammar that ensures the verb in a sentence matches the subject in **number** (singular or plural). Proper subject-verb agreement is key to constructing clear and grammatically correct sentences.

## What Is Subject-Verb Agreement?

In subject-verb agreement:
- **Singular subjects** take **singular verbs**.
- **Plural subjects** take **plural verbs**.

### Example:
- _The cat **runs** quickly._ (singular subject and singular verb)
- _The cats **run** quickly._ (plural subject and plural verb)

## Basic Rules of Subject-Verb Agreement

### 1. Singular Subjects Take Singular Verbs

For most verbs in the present tense, add an **-s** to the verb when the subject is singular.

#### Examples:
- _She **walks** to school._
- _The dog **barks** at strangers._
- _My friend **is** a teacher._

### 2. Plural Subjects Take Plural Verbs

When the subject is plural, the verb does not end in **-s**.

#### Examples:
- _They **walk** to school._
- _The dogs **bark** at strangers._
- _My friends **are** teachers._

## Special Cases in Subject-Verb Agreement

There are some special situations where subject-verb agreement can be tricky. Below are key cases to watch out for.

### 1. Compound Subjects

- **Subjects joined by _and_** take a plural verb.
  - _John and Mary **are** coming to the party._
  
- **Subjects joined by _or_ or _nor_**: The verb agrees with the subject **closest** to it.
  - _Neither the teacher nor the students **are** ready for the test._
  - _Either the dogs or the cat **is** making noise._

### 2. Indefinite Pronouns

Some indefinite pronouns are **always singular** and take a singular verb:
- _Everyone, Someone, Nobody, Each, Either, Neither, Anybody._

#### Examples:
- _Everyone **is** excited about the trip._
- _Neither of the options **is** appealing._

Other indefinite pronouns are **always plural** and take a plural verb:
- _Both, Few, Many, Several._

#### Examples:
- _Both **are** correct._
- _Few **understand** the question._

Some indefinite pronouns can be **singular or plural**, depending on context:
- _All, Some, None, Any._

#### Examples:
- _All of the cake **is** gone._ (singular)
- _All of the students **are** here._ (plural)

### 3. Collective Nouns

**Collective nouns** (e.g., team, family, class) can take either singular or plural verbs, depending on whether the group is acting as a unit or as individuals.

- Use a singular verb if the group is acting as one:
  - _The team **wins** every game._

- Use a plural verb if the individuals in the group are acting separately:
  - _The team **are** arguing among themselves._

### 4. Subjects Separated by Prepositional Phrases

A prepositional phrase (e.g., _of the_, _in the_) between the subject and the verb should not affect the verb. The verb must agree with the subject, not the object of the prepositional phrase.

- _The bouquet **of flowers** **is** beautiful._  
  (_Bouquet_ is the subject, not _flowers_.)

- _The book **on the shelves** **was** interesting._  
  (_Book_ is the subject, not _shelves_.)

### 5. Titles and Plural Forms

- **Titles of books, movies, or works** are treated as singular, even if they seem plural.
  - _“The Chronicles of Narnia” **is** a popular series._

- **Plural words with singular meanings** (e.g., mathematics, news) take singular verbs.
  - _Mathematics **is** difficult for some students._

## Common Errors in Subject-Verb Agreement

### 1. Matching Verbs with the Wrong Subject

Be careful not to let words that come between the subject and verb cause confusion. The verb should match the **main subject**.

- _The girl with her friends **is** excited._ (The subject is _girl_, not _friends_.)

### 2. Confusing Singular and Plural Indefinite Pronouns

Some indefinite pronouns can be confusing. Remember that words like _everyone_, _each_, and _nobody_ are singular, while _many_, _few_, and _both_ are plural.

- _Each of the players **is** ready._ (Not _are_.)
- _Both of the books **are** interesting._

## Quick Tips for Subject-Verb Agreement

1. **Identify the subject** and make sure it agrees with the verb.
2. **Ignore phrases** that come between the subject and verb.
3. Be careful with **indefinite pronouns** (like _everyone_ and _some_).
4. **Watch out for collective nouns** and determine if the group is acting as one or as individuals.
5. Remember that **titles** and **singular-looking plurals** like _news_ take singular verbs.
